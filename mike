mike can you separate the polyderivative function so that it's two different functions:
one that splits the derivative and returns terms, exponentDouble, constantDouble, and splitIndex
and one that finds the derivatives
the first one can be used for other classes
i tried to do it today but it triggered a bunch of errors
